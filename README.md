# API Development and Documentation Final Project

## Trivia App

This is a game in which users can put their knowledge to the test by answering trivia questions. The project's goal is to develop an API and a test suite for implementing the following features:

1. Show all of the questions, as well as categories of questions. By default, questions display the question, category, and difficulty rating, and the solution can be shown or hidden.
2. Remove any queries that are unnecessary.
3. Include questions with question and response text.
4. Use a text query string to find questions to answer.
5. Play the quiz game with all questions or a specific category randomly selected.

## Steps to Contribute

<!-- The [frontend](./frontend/README.md) directory contains a complete React frontend to consume the data from the Flask server. If you have prior experience building a frontend application, you should feel free to edit the endpoints as you see fit for the backend you design. If you do not have prior experience building a frontend application, you should read through the frontend code before starting and make notes regarding:

1. What are the end points and HTTP methods the frontend is expecting to consume?
2. How are the requests from the frontend formatted? Are they expecting certain parameters or payloads?

Pay special attention to what data the frontend is expecting from each API response to help guide how you format your API. The places where you may change the frontend behavior, and where you should be looking for the above information, are marked with `TODO`. These are the files you'd want to edit in the frontend:

1. `frontend/src/components/QuestionView.js`
2. `frontend/src/components/FormView.js`
3. `frontend/src/components/QuizView.js`

By making notes ahead of time, you will practice the core skill of being able to read and understand code and will have a simple plan to follow to build out the endpoints of your backend API. -->
